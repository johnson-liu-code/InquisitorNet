Phase 3 outline (for later; not implemented)

Goal: Introduce Inquisitors (Set-3) with review-before-post flow and dossier generation (kept private in your own subreddit), leveraging the Policy Gate.

Main Features:

Inquisitor agent that consumes detector_marks, decides high|medium|low, and prepares planned_action (post draft|dossier|log).

Dossier writer (markdown + JSON header) pulling only allow-listed domain history.

Human review queue + Policy Gate check â†’ approve/deny drafts for your private subreddit.

Implementation Details:

New tables for planned_actions and dossiers; re-use policy_checks.

CLI to render and queue drafts; optional email of queue summaries.

Agreed Specifications:

No public posting; private sub only; human review mandatory.

Strict anonymization and allow-list constraints remain in force.

Notable Considerations:

Gate false positives mitigation; add adjustable redaction bands; keep logs audit-friendly.
