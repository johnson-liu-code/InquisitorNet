Let's start with adjusting Phase 1 plan. And let's focus on Phase 1 for now. Do not present the other phases.

What this phase should achieve:
1. Implement Set-1 Scrapers. Have functionality to control which subreddits can be accessed.
2. Implement Set-2 Detectors. These bots consume data generated from Set-1 Scrapers. These bots uses a lighter LLM along with my set of rules to score "potential heresy" and to explain what rules were matched. Also explains why a post was deemed benign.
3. No need for retention controls and redaction rules yet. Push this to Phase 3.
4. Central database to store: posts potentially containing heretical content (along with meta data) – this data is created by Set-1 Scrapers; marked posts requiring further investigation (along with meta data) – this data is created by Set-2 Detectors; acquitted posts (along with meta data) – this data is created by Set-2 Detectors; thoughts, discussions, and actions of inquisitors – this data is created by Set-3 Inquisitors; and summaries – this data is created by Set-5 Summarizers.

Definition of done:
1. A config file to store the subreddit allowed/restricted lists.
2. A config file containing rules for Set-1 Scrapers.
3. A config file containing rules for Set-2 Detectors.
4. Set-1 Scrapers extracts information from subreddits through Reddit's API as intended.
5. Set-1 Scrapers keeps posts of interest and throws away everything else.
6. Set-1 Scrapers saves the following to the database: {detected_comment, post_meta_data, key_words_hit}.
7. Set-2 Detectors efficiently combs through data generated by Set-1 Scrapers.
8. Set-2 Detectors analyze comments using their light LLM and mark those that require further investigation. Posts that are deemed benign are saved separately from the marked posts.
9. Set-2 Detectors saves the following to the database for marked posts: {comment, post_meta_data, reasoning_for_mark, degree_of_confidence}.
10. Set-2 Detectors saves the following to the database for "benign" posts: {comment, post_meta_data, reasoning_for_aquittal, degree_of_confidence}.
11. A database as described above.


Note: I have to create the first private subreddit(s), which will take a little over a month to do due to Reddit's subreddit creation policies.

Note: Should I use Emergent to build this project? Or should I use you?
